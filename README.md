# This is my undergrad thesis project

The effectiveness of machine learning to diagnose patientsâ€™ illnesses has been
the subject of extensive research over the past ten years. Machine learning has
been found to considerably lower the probability of inaccurate diagnoses when
incorporated into modern diagnostic procedures. I have tried to develop a method
for diagnosing the three most similarly symptomized cough-type chronic diseases:
COPD, Bronchial Asthma and Pneumonia, with the goal of having an influence
on the healthcare system. The symptoms of cough-type disease patients,
admitted to the hospital were collected from eight medical colleges spread out
over Bangladesh in order to construct the classifying model.
I have used a set of 28 attributes for appropriately classifying cough-
type chronic diseases. The obtained data is examined, and the main research
findings are explained. Several machine learning methods are tested using the
dataset. I have found and suggested Gradient Tree Boosting to be
the most effective, with a classification accuracy of 91%, despite the fact that
previous studies have identified Support Vector Machine and Random Forest to
be the most efficient models in these kind of classification tasks.
